# GeoFRESH

GeoFRESH (geofresh.org) is a platform that helps freshwater researchers to process point data across the global river network by providing a set of spatial tools.

Follow the tutorial or upload your csv-table that contains geographic coordinates. GeoFRESH allows you to

- map your points,
- move points to the nearest stream network segment,
- delineate upstream catchments of each point,
- extract a suite of environmental attributes across the catchment,
- and download the data for further analyses.

GeoFRESH is based on the Hydrography90m stream network. For more information, please visit [hydrography.org](https://hydrography.org/).
